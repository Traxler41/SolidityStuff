# SolidityStuff
Contains Basic Code about Solidity. Use them if you are learning blockchain.

1. VotingContract.sol is a basic solidity code. It demonstrates how a smart contract is made and how it's deployed.
2. SimpleStorage.sol demonstrates a few more functionalities of Solidity.
3. PriceConvertor.sol demonstrates the use of ChainLink Data feeds by converting USD/ETH on the Sepolia ETH network.
4. FundMe.sol demonstrates how to receive donations from users in the form of ETH and withdraw it from the smart contract only by the Owner.
5. Deploy.js is a Javascript code to deploy a smart contract directly from your workplace to a Blockchain Network. It uses packages like ethers and fs-extra.
6. Fibonacci.sol gives the nth number of the fibonacci series for the input n.
7. CardGame.sol is a card game that allows the Owner to enter four players and assign them 4 initial cards(THE GAME HAS 4 TYPES OF CARDS. EACH TYPE HAS 4 CARDS. TOTAL = 16 CARDS). The objective of the players to win the game by passing a card of their choice to the next player and the player having 4 cards of one type can claim victory. It also has a function that ends the game without any winners after 1 hour has passed.This is necessary because a player can always hold one card of each type that nullifies the chances of other players winning the game and it goes on forever.
